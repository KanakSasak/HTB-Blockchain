# Ethernaut CTF Write-ups with Hardhat

This repository contains my solutions and write-ups for the Ethernaut CTF challenges by OpenZeppelin, developed and tested using the Hardhat Ethereum development environment.

### Introduction

Ethernaut is a Web3/Solidity based wargame played in the Ethereum Virtual Machine. Each level is a smart contract that needs to be 'hacked'. The challenges are designed to teach Ethereum principles and concepts. This repository uses Hardhat to streamline the development, testing, and deployment of these solutions.


### Challenges
